# calculate-pi visual-output
These Python scripts will calculate pi for you

The [calculate-pi](https://github.com/HermanErKu/calculate-pi-visual-output/blob/main/calculate-pi.py) script will will calculate pi for you in the terminal. You can change the "points" variable to get a more excact pi, but this will take longer time.

The [calculate-pi-visual](https://github.com/HermanErKu/calculate-pi-visual-output/blob/main/calculate-pi-visual.py) script will calculate pi for you in the terminal, but it also opens a 500x500px window where it shows you all the points it places. You will be asked in the terminal how many points you want to place. This script will use a bit more time than the non-visual script.

# How to use
These scripts are very simple and easy to use.                                                                                                                 
All of the scripts were made in python 3.9, and if you have any problems running them, make sure your pc has python 3.9 installed.
