# calculate-pi-visual-output
These Python scripts will calculate pi for you

The [calculate-pi](https://github.com/HermanErKu/calculate-pi-visual-output/blob/main/calculate-pi.py) script will will calculate pi for you in the terminal. You can change the "points" variable to get a more excact pi, but this will take longer time.

The [calculate-pi-visual](https://github.com/HermanErKu/calculate-pi-visual-output/blob/main/calculate-pi-visual.py) script will calculate pi for you in the terminal, but it also opens a 500x500px window where it shows you all the points it places. You will be asked in the terminal how many points you want to place. This script will use a bit more time than the non-visual script.
